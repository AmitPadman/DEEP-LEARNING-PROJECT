A functional model in deep learning is a flexible framework for building neural networks, allowing for complex architectures like models with multiple inputs, outputs, or shared layers. Unlike simpler sequential models, functional models explicitly define connections between layers, offering more versatility. For example, you can create branching or merging pathways in the network. After training, visualizations are crucial for understanding model performance. These include accuracy and loss curves to track learning progress, confusion matrices to evaluate classification performance, and techniques like Grad-CAM to highlight which parts of an input (e.g., an image) influenced the model's predictions. Such models and visualizations help in building and interpreting advanced neural networks effectively.


A functional deep learning model leverages modular and flexible frameworks like TensorFlow's Keras Functional API or PyTorch. It allows complex architectures, such as models with multiple inputs, outputs, or shared layers. Here's a detailed description with the inclusion of visualizations:

1) Scattered plot of sample data
2) Bar chart
3) Histogram of random data
4) Sine wave plot
